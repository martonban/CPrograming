# C Programming
In this semester I'll participate at evoCampus where me and my teammates will develop a robot OS. Before that I want to practice some C, becasue I used it last time like 3 years ago. That's why it's not a structured repository, it's just a code dump for little projects and follow along tutorial code. Every code will have some explenetory comments.
